# Working Patches
acceptQuest
completeQuest


# Not Working Patches
getClientQuests
failQuest // Fail quest doesn't seem to work well - at least on Supply Plans. Instead, failQuests seems to be called instead. I wonder if there is a way to modify my code to not use keyof QuestController and instead I could get the properties the same way I'm getting all methods
